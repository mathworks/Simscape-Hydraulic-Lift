Here are some key points about this demonstration model.

1. You must run "startup_Hydraulic_Lift.m" to set the path and load key values.

2. You will need a supported compiler.

3. There are variants for several subsystems that include blocks from Simscape add-on products.
   You can use those variants by double-clicking on the "Configure" subsystem,
   and then double-click on the "Custom" or "Standard" subsystems to select the variant.
   The OpenFcn for the subsystems uses the replace_block() command to insert the variant.
